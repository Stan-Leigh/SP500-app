# SP500-app

In this repository, I use Heroku to deploy an app built on streamlit. The app collects the list of company stocks in the S&P 500 and plots its corresponding closing price year to date.

The data for each stock is collected from the yfinance library. This data is used to generate the plots.

The deployed web app is live at https://st-sp500.herokuapp.com/
